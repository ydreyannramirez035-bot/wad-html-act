   <h2>About Me</h2> 
    <i><p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        Hi! I'm Ydrey Ann Ramirez—as you can see from the title, hehe. 
        I'm currently taking the Associate in Computer Technology course.
        I'm from Rizal, but I'm currently renting a place on ADD Street.
        I'd say school life here in LV is fun but sometimes challenging, especially since it's my first time living away from my family.
        I just wanted to share a little bit about myself in this paragraph.

    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        I don’t want to say too much, 'cause once I start talking, I can’t stop saying random things. 
        Sooo, I’ll just make this a bit longer by sharing a few more things about me, haha.
        I believe you'll get to know me just from this paragraph.
        I’m a yapper—though sometimes I get tired easily and lose the energy to socialize.
        Most of the time, I’m quiet, and that’s usually because I don’t know what to say.
        But I hope my classmates understand that and still want to hang out with me.
    
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        This will be the last paragraph for the intro.
        In the next sections, you’ll get to know me more—from my hobbies, to my skills, and my achievements.
        I hope you read all the way to the end.
        I wish you enjoy scrolling through this website as much as I enjoyed making it. Thanks be to God!
